            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my page!
                Despite being a business student graduate and working a finance job, I've now taken an intense interest
                in programming.
                I'm looking to make a switch into the world of software engineering and web development!</p>

                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p> Before I took my first programming class as a breadth subject, I thought that programming was some
                    alien thing that only a select few could ever hope to comprehend. Since then, I've dabbled
                    in Java to learn OOP, taken CS50 on EdX which
                    introduced me
                    to core computer science concepts in C, then abstracted from that with higher-level languages such
                    as Python and Javascript. Now I think programming is probably the coolest thing ever. ✨✨

                <h3>Mead Brewing</h3>
                <p>Mead is a honey wine that at its most core is simply made with just honey and water! I enjoy being
                    able to own the brewing process
                    from beginning to end and create flavours that are unique to my own tastes. Brewing mead is a slow
                    and elegant process, that is simple
                    but when done with precision and care, yields immense satisfaction for me.</p>
